## 🎨 OPTIONAL: ADD MORE IMAGES

If you want to add more images to other sections, you can:

### 1. Add Background Images to Sections
Edit `index.css` and add background images to sections like:
- `.features-modern`
- `.values-timeline`
- `.stats-circular`

### 2. Add Image Elements in HTML
You can add `<img>` tags in sections where you want to showcase:
- Lab equipment
- Student projects
- Faculty members
- Campus facilities

Example:
```html
<div class="ece-gallery">
    <img src="lab_equipment.jpg" alt="ECE Lab Equipment">
    <img src="students_project.jpg" alt="Students Working on Project">
    <img src="vlsi_lab.jpg" alt="VLSI Design Lab">
</div>
```
